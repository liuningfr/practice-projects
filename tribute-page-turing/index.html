                        <h3>Here's a time line of Mr.Turing's life:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London.</li>
                            <li><strong>1927</strong> - Alan becomes deeply interested in the work of Albert Einstein and is able to develop work done by Einstein based on a questioning of Newton's Laws of Motion.</li>
                            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Alan's work is so distinguished that he is elected Fellow of King's College, aged only 23.</li>
                            <li><strong>1939</strong> - Alan is asked to join the Government Codes and Ciphers School and arrives at Bletchley Park the day after war is declared.</li>        
                            <li><strong>1940</strong> - Alan and his colleagues also manage to break the more complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is a tremendous help to the Allies in the Battle of the Atlantic.</li>        
                            <li><strong>1945</strong> - At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded the OBE for his wartime services.</li>      
                            <li><strong>1950</strong> - Alan publishes'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he develops the Turing Test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent. The paper will become very famous.</li>        
                            <li><strong>1952</strong> - Alan is arrested for gross indecency and loses his security clearance. He is offered chemical treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment has a very detrimental effect on him.</li>
                            <li><strong>1954</strong> - Alan's body is found in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The post-mortem finds that his death had been caused by poisoning. A half-eaten apple is found next to him laced with cyanide. His body is cremated at Woking crematorium.</li>    
                            <li><strong>1966</strong> - The annual Turing Award is established and given each year to a person for technical contributions to the computing community. It is generally viewed as important as the Nobel Prize.</li>        
                            <li><strong>2009</strong> - In response to a petition signed by thousands of people, The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown issues a public apology in which he describes the treatment of Alan Turing as "appalling".</li>             
                        </ul>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"Alan Turing was the first to make a careful analysis of the potential capabilities of machines, inventing his famous "Turing machines" for the purpose."</p>
